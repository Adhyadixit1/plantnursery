      plant: "Miyazaki Mango",
      review: "I purchased a Miyazaki mango sapling 3 years ago and it finally fruited this season! The taste is absolutely incredible - nothing like any mango I've ever had. The sweetness is unreal and the texture is like butter. Worth every penny of the â‚¹30,000 I paid. The team provided excellent care instructions and follow-up support.",
      story: "As a fruit enthusiast, this has been a dream come true. My neighbors can't believe the quality of mangoes growing in my Mumbai terrace garden!"

      review: "The Queen of the Night orchid I bought bloomed for the first time last month and the experience was magical! The fragrance filled my entire house and lasted the whole night. My family and I stayed awake just to witness this rare beauty. The customer service was exceptional - they even called to remind me about the expected bloom time.",

      plant: "Chocolate Cosmos",
      review: "Being a botanist, I was skeptical about the chocolate fragrance claim, but I was completely blown away! The scent is genuinely chocolate-like, and the flowers are stunning. It's become the centerpiece of my research garden. Students are always amazed when they smell it. The plant care documentation provided was scientifically accurate and very helpful.",

      plant: "Dragon Fruit Cactus",
      review: "My dragon fruit plant has been producing beautiful fruits for the past year. The taste is so much better than store-bought ones - fresh, sweet, and the texture is perfect. The plant itself is architectural and adds a unique element to my garden design. Great investment for both aesthetics and taste!",

      review: "The Ylang Ylang tree has transformed my garden into a paradise. The fragrance is therapeutic - I literally feel more relaxed when I'm near it. My wife uses the flowers to make natural perfume oil. Despite Rajasthan's harsh climate, it's thriving with the care guidance provided. Absolutely recommended for anyone who loves natural fragrances.",
